## App's functionality

1. Screen Navigation
-The Task Route app features three screens: the home page, which displays the to-do list; the create task screen, where users can add a task with a title, description, and deadline; and the task detail screen, which shows the selected task from the home page and includes an edit option.

2. Named Routes 
- This app defines three named routes: the default route ('/'), '/task_detail', and '/create_task', each with navigation functionality.

3. Passing Data Between Screens
-In this app, when the user clicks on a task from the to-do list page, the details of that task are displayed on the task detail page.

4. Navigation Animation 
-A fade page route has been implemented to enhance the app's user experience, and the back arrow on both the task detail and create task screens navigates the user back to the home page when clicked.
